## MAKE SURE YOUR CODE COMPILES. NO EXCEPTIONS!!!!

It is important that your last commit on your pull request, at the end of your efforts today, compiles cleanly.
Try to pass as many tests as you can. If you have tests that do no pass, you
must not comment out the tests; you should have methods that allow the test to fail, if neccessary.
Your entire project MUST COMPILE without errors. 

**PLEASE DO NOT FORGET TO READ THE READMES**
